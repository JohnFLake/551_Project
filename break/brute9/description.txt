The team only uses a number from 0 - 9999 as the card contents. As a result, the content of the card file for an arbitrary account is easily guessed using brute force.
This attack doesn't always work due to the server timeout. However, on my own test system I was able to brute force a card in 1h40m on average and 3h20m guaranteed (based on the rate at which I could send requests to the bank).
